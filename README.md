# Django-Poll-App
Django Poll App is a fully-featured polling application. Users must register to view polls and cast their votes. Each user can vote only once per poll. Poll owners have full control over their polls â€” they can create, edit, update, and delete polls, as well as manage choices (add, update, or delete) and close polls. Once a poll is closed, it can no longer accept votes and will only display the final results.

The app also includes a powerful search and filtering system, allowing users to filter polls by title, publish date, or number of votes. Pagination is supported and remains functional even after filters are applied, ensuring smooth navigation through large sets of polls.
